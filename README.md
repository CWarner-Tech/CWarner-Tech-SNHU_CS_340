How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is essential for scalable development. In my CRUD Python module, I separated the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions to keep each one focused and reusable, making them easier to debug and understand. By using Python’s pymongo library and creating a central connection method, I made the code modular and readable, allowing for easy adaptation in future projects. The structured CRUD module streamlined database connectivity in Project Two’s dashboard, letting me focus on UI while maintaining reliable data operations.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I used an analytical, structured approach to tackle Grazioso Salvare’s project requirements. Starting with requirement analysis, I ensured each element (e.g., dog filtering by rescue type) was mapped to a specific dashboard or database function. I optimized the MongoDB database with indexing for quick access and applied iterative development, refining each feature individually. This approach differed from previous assignments by focusing on end-to-end integration between the frontend and backend, teaching me the value of a holistic, modular design.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists create solutions that streamline processes and inform decision-making. This project supports Grazioso Salvare’s mission by enabling efficient categorization of dogs for search-and-rescue training. Through a database-backed dashboard, users can quickly filter and analyze data, making manual tasks faster and providing insights into breed suitability. By bridging technology and mission-driven work, this project demonstrates how computer science enhances organizational effectiveness and impact.
